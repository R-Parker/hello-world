Hello! Welcome to Ryan Parker's first self-made repository, "Hello World"
Created on: 14-Aug-2020
Last updated: 14-Aug-2020, by Ryan Parker

Practiced making changes to see how Git records them.

Here are the commands I've learned so far:

Within Terminal (Git Bash or Command Prompt):
`````````````````````````````````````````````
mkdir <FOLDERNAME>: creates a folder in the default directory
cd <FOLDERNAME>: enters a directory (folder); stands for Change directory
ls: lists the files within a folder

Git commands
git config --global user.name "<USERNAME>": name recorded with commits
git config --global user.email "<EMAIL>": email recorded with commits
git init: creates repository in selected folder
git status: indicates the status of commits for the current folder
git add <FILENAME>: stages the file for the next commits
git commit -m "<DESCRIPTION OF CHANGES MADE>"
